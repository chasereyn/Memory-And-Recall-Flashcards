Princess
You must be my Cinderella because I’m going to make that dress vanish at midnight

Pie
Are you a pie? Because I’d like a piece of you

I'm working
I should probably be working. But I'd rather be daydreaming about you

I love calling with you
I'm only one call away, don't forget that

Sugar
Are you sugar? Because you're looking pretty sweet

Flower
If you were a flower, you’d be a damn-delion

Lips
Your lips look lonely. How about I introduce them to mine?

Cold
Are you a blanket? Because I love when you’re on top of me

Ice Cream
You must be ice cream because I wanna lick you up

Pancake
Are you a pancake? Because I'm ready to flip you over

Estrella
Eres mi estrella. iluminas mi mundo en un instance

Fuego
Eres un fuego que no quiero apagar, mi amor

You look great!
I though Christmas only comes once a year

Love
Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anything you feel like it
