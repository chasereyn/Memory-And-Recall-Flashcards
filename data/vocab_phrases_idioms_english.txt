kick rocks

they're gonna be upset
they're gonna cry when it happens

you don't win
you don't pass go...you don't collect $200

Shit!
Barnacles

I think we can do it
Never tell me the odds

Balls
I’m gonna check something…ok I don’t have testicular cancer I'm good

Falling
Who turned up the gravity in here

It's raining
There's a torrential downpour

My computer is slow
My PC is fuming

We still, in the year of our Lord 2025, cannot figure out how to...

Everyone thinks everything is ok
Everyone's fat and happy

You figured it out?
Have you enrolled in the cranium expansion program?

He chose to do it
He did it on his own volition

This is crazy!
I thought I was from the trenches, but I ain’t never seen nothin like this

It's nice to see you guys
You guys look great!

I'm wondering...
Riddle me this...

But I didn't know that...
However, unbeknownst to me,...

Having said that...
Be that as it may

Basically
I said all this to say

It's not working
The demogods are not with me today

I have a feeling that...
My spider sense tells me that...

It's tough out there
We live in a dog eat dog world

There they are
Several creatures southeast

Let's go
Let's hit the hyperdrive

So bad
Abysmal

We need to change
We need to adapt

Pretty good at
Adept at

Was enough for
Was adequate for

They were against each other
The relationship was adversarial

Began to weaken / got weaker
Began to abate

He mentioned that
He alluded to

They were disagreeing
They had an altercation

I don't know if I like it
I feel ambivalence about it

It's basically the same as
It's analogous to

Destroy
Annihilate

That seems weird
That's an anomaly

We're at the top
We've reached the apex

We were nervous when
There was a sense of apprehension when

He told us we had to
He asserted that we

He's a pretty serious guy
He has quite an austere demeanor

We tried everything
We explored every avenue

I really like to / I really enjoy watching sunsets
I am an avid sunset watcher

I got there early
I feel like I came to open the doors

I agree
I'm in agreeance

Everything
Everything in the kitchen sink

Don't buy garbage
Buy it nice or buy it twice

It indicates that...
It is indicative that...

Ugly
Grotesque

He really fell for that one

<Spills a drink>
That's one way to break the ice

<Phone dies>
Dead battery, how shocking

<Bad Pun>
You should be arrested for that

<Workout fail>
The weight was too much to handle

<Tech Problems>
It's not you it's Windows...actually it's both

What a bitch

General Insult
He has a face for radio and a voice for silent movies

You're wrong
I'd agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong

Secrets
You're secrets are safe with me, I wasn't even listening

Insult 2
He's proof that evolution can go in reverse

He's dumb
Light travels faster than sound, that's why he seems bright until he speaks

<Someone is full of themselves>
Don't trip over your ego on the way out

Are you busy?
Can you unlock for 30 seconds?

It's really important culturally
It's a cultural moment

Fallback
Fallback...or should I say spring ahead

Barely
By the skin of your teeth

That was fortunate
That was serendipitous

He can turn any conversation into a smart discussion
He can turn any conversation into an erudite discussion

He is quite a curteous gentleman
He is quite an urbane gentleman

This isn't really working
I guess I rolled a gutterball with this...

I don't understand
Everything looks like hieroglyphics

He not the brightest
He's got a few wifi bars missing

Ready?
Ready freddy?

You become your 5 closest friends
He who walks with wolves learns to howl
